						<h2><img src="/assets/images/header--faqs.png" alt="FAQs" /></h2>

						<h3>1. Can I bring my partner/friend/cat?</h3>
						<p>We're sorry to say that due to limited venue space that we can't extend the invite to +1s, unless directly specified. However, we'd love them to join us post 7pm for drinks and dancing.</p>
						<p>Please <a href="#rsvp">RSVP</a> separately for your evening guests <a href="#rsvp">here</a> and include in brackets that they are your +1. We will be doing a guestlist for the night and will need to add them to it</p>

						<h3>2. Are my children invited too?</h3>
						<p>Apologies - but this is an adult-only event.</p>

						<h3>3. Will there be alcohol?</h3>
						<p>Of course! You have met us, right? There will be a bar that takes card payments. Because we are stocking the bar ourselves choices will be slightly limited and all drinks will be £3 to cover costs.</p>

						<h3>4. What should I wear?</h3>
						<p>Whatever you please! There is no dress code.</p>

						<h3>5. Which hotels do you recommend?</h3>
						<p>To be honest, there's so many close by that you're better off checking trip advisor. Airbnb has some good options too. Please book soon though because the London Marathon is the next day, so places may book up quickly.</p>

						<h3>6. Is there an official hashtag?</h3>
						<p>Yes. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mrandmrspoole">#mrandmrspoole</a>. Please make us trend.</p>

						<h3>7. Will the cats be coming?</h3>
						<p>No - because we couldn't trust Hex not to go all 'Mrs Robinson, Mrs Robinson' at the church.</p>

						<h3>8. Am I invited to the day bit or just the evening bit?</h3>
						<p>No idea. Email us to check.</p>

						<h3>9. Is there parking?</h3>
						<p>Since the London Marathon is happening on the Sunday we aren't sure of the parking situation on the Saturday, and since it is London we don't think it is worth driving.</p>
						<p>But, public transport between venues is top notch. You can get a tube to <strong>Tower Hill</strong> or <strong>Aldgate</strong> / <strong>Aldgate East</strong> or the DLR to <strong>Shadwell</strong> and walk to the church. From the church, it is a one stop DLR ride to <strong>Limehouse</strong>, 20 min walk or less-than-10-min Uber (code AASSW for £10 off) journey to the reception venue.</p>
						
						<h3>10. What time do I have to be there?</h3>
						<p>Please be seated at the church by 12.40 and arrive at the reception venue for 3pm.</p>

						<h3>11. I'd love to help - what can I do?</h3>
						<p>Word of warning: we're putting this all on ourselves, so please don't expect a polished operation. In fact, everything could go horribly wrong... So, in the event of a disaster/mishap please grin and bear it. Or just get so horribly drunk that it doesn't matter any more.</p>
						<p>The biggest help you can give us is to try and hold on to your glasses between rounds and throw your rubbish in the bins provided.</p>
						<p>We will be decorating the venue the night before, so if you want to lend a hand then, you're more than welcome to join us.</p>

						<h3>12. Got a question we haven't answered?</h3>

						<p>First of all - we want to say that you absolutely do not have to give us a present. You joining us on our special day (which we appreciate is probably tiresome and costly for a lot of you!) is a gift enough.</p>
						<p>But if you do want to give us a gift, we thought it would make life a little easier if we put together some options for you to choose from:</p>
						<ul class="bulleted">
							<li>A bottle of gin - need we say more?</li>
							<li><a href="http://www.zarahome.com/gb/en/fragrance-c1175510.html">Zara homeware reed diffusers</a>. Because, our house smells of cat otherwise.</li>
							<li>A plant.</li>
							<li>Fancy candles. Again, because we smell.</li>
							<li>Taxidermy - because Nicky is writing this list.</li>
							<li>A contribution towards our honeymoon fund.</li>
							<li>Tea towels.</li>
							<li>New socks for Dave (size 12).</li>
							<li>Groupon Vouchers - so that we can have lots of adventures.</li>
							<li>A drawing of a cat.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>There will be a post box for cards etc. at the venue.</p>
						<p>We have also put a list of larger items here in case people want to team up and buy a joint present / would prefer to buy something at a click of a button.</p>
